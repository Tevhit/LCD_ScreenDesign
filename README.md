MBED - STM32F429 DISCO board -LCD screen design - C code

This design consists two text lines and two rectangles. The rectangles are used to control the boardâ€™s LEDs. The green rectangle is for the green LED and the red one is for the red LED. If you touch to one of these rectangles, the relevent LED turn on. If you touch second time to the same rectangle, the LED turn off.

I write the code for STM32F429 DISCO board.
